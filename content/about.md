My name is Kai Zhang. You can know more about me on the [homepage](/) and my [**vitae**](/pdf/viate.pdf). You can also contact me at [kaiwhu@gmail.com](mailto:kaiwhu@gmail.com).

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/kayzhang/). Subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../index.xml) or [all comments](https://yihui.disqus.com/latest.rss) to stay tuned. I used to provide a [guestbook](../guestbook/) page for people to leave me messages, but now I think it makes more sense just to leave comments on this page. I don't like formality, so it is not necessary to call me "Dr Xie" when you email me or introduce me to your friends. I'm a software engineer, so please don't call me professor.

# Research Experience

1. Multi-objective Optimization of Transmission Lines Maintenance (Sept. 2015 - Aug. 2017)
    - Implemented multi-objective optimization algorithms in MATLAB.
    - Compared the global searching ability and the convergence speed of several different types of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.
    - Established objective functions and constraint conditions for maintenance of transmission lines.
    - Obtained the optimal maintenance strategy of transmission lines.
1. Metering Methods of Grid-connected Distributed Power Supply (Jul. 2014 - May. 2015)
    - Detected a potential problem in grid-connected distributed power measurement strategy.
    - Improved the metering algorithm for grid-connected distributed power stations.
    - Designed a metering environment monitoring device to address the potential problems of traditional measurement in distributed power supply.
1. On-line Automatic Water Quality Monitor for Remote Areas (Mar. 2013 - May. 2014)
    - Implemented an automatic power generator based on micro water flow to provide stable output
electricity with stable voltage.
    - Accomplished an automatic water quality monitor using related sensors for remote areas.
    - Implemented wireless signal transmission using wireless data communication module.
1. Obstacle-avoiding Smart Car (Feb. 2013 - Mar. 2013)
    - Implemented obstacle recognition and tracking using LabVIEW Vision Development Module.
    - Measured the distance between the smart car and an obstacle using several distance sensors.
    - Accomplished velocity and direction control of smart car through MCU.

# Extracurricular Activities
1. Volunteer Teaching in Xiaogan, Hubei Province (July. 2013)
    - Taught pupils, most of whom were left-behind children, different subjects at a primary school.
    - Arranged special courses to provide psychosocial support for the kids to enhance their inner world.
2. Helping Mentally Retarded Children Aug. 2013
    - Developed a volunteer program to help mentally retarded children.
    - Did home visits to teach the kids some basic living skills.
    - Taught the kids how to make simple handicrafts, hoping to provide them with a possible choice of
means to earn a living by themselves.
    - Organized a university bazaar of the handicrafts made by the kids in order to appeal to more people
to pay attention to mentally retarded children.
