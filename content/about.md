My name is Kai Zhang. You can know more about me on the [homepage](/). You can also contact me at [kaiwhu@gmail.com](mailto:kaiwhu@gmail.com).

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/kayzhang/). Subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../index.xml) or [all comments](https://yihui.disqus.com/latest.rss) to stay tuned. I used to provide a [guestbook](../guestbook/) page for people to leave me messages, but now I think it makes more sense just to leave comments on this page.

This site is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the theme is [hugo-ivy](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy), a Hugo theme desiged by [Yihui](https://github.com/yihui), the author of [*blogdown*](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).

# Research Experience

1. Machine Learning & Computer Vision (2018)
    - Acquired some general methods about ML, like naive bayes, linear regression, softmax regression and neural network.
    - Implemented image classification on MNIST dataset using linear regression, softmax regression and neural network, and compared their performance.
    - Built an image classification system trained on CIFAR-10 dataset with CNN under TensorFlow.
    - Built an image captioning system trained on Flickr8K dataset with CNN under Tensorflow.

1. Multi-objective Optimization of Transmission Lines Maintenance (2017)
    - Implemented multi-objective optimization algorithms in MATLAB.
    - Compared the global searching ability and the convergence speed of several different types of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.
    - Established objective functions and constraint conditions for maintenance of transmission lines.
    - Obtained the optimal maintenance strategy of transmission lines.

# Extracurricular Activities
1. Volunteer Teaching in Xiaogan, Hubei Province
    - Taught pupils, most of whom were left-behind children, different subjects at a primary school.
    - Arranged special courses to provide psychosocial support for the kids to enhance their inner world.
2. Helping Mentally Retarded Children
    - Developed a volunteer program to help mentally retarded children.
    - Did home visits to teach the kids some basic living skills.
    - Taught the kids how to make simple handicrafts, hoping to provide them with a possible choice of
means to earn a living by themselves.
    - Organized a university bazaar of the handicrafts made by the kids in order to appeal to more people
to pay attention to mentally retarded children.
