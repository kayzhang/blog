This is a repo to host the (Markdown) source files of my personal website. The Hugo template is licensed under MIT, and the content of all pages is licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

To build the website locally, you must clone this repo with its submodule (use the `--recursive` argument), e.g.,

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:kayzhang/blog.giti
```

The website is built via the R package [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). Please read its documentation for how to use it.

This Hugo theme was ported from [Yihui](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy), the author of **blogdown**.
